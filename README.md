# sleepy helper
my first celeste mod !!

it was made to be used in my own map, but feel free to use it in yours or do anything you want with it

## list of things this helper adds
- Flag Toggle Color Grade Fade Trigger: a flag-toggled variant of the Color Grade Fade Trigger from [Maddie's Helping Hand](https://github.com/maddie480/MaddieHelpingHand). 
- Freeze Player If In StDummy Trigger: while inside this trigger, if you are in StDummy (for example, in a cutscene), you'll be frozen (0 horizontal & vertical speed) until you leave StDummy.
- Set StReflectionFall Delay Trigger: while inside this trigger, if you enter StReflectionFall, the amount of time before you start falling is changed from 2 seconds to a configurable delay in frames.
