# SleepyHelper
my first celeste mod !!

it was made to be used in my own map, but feel free to use it in yours or do anything you want with it

## list of things this helper adds
- Set StReflectionFall Delay Trigger: while inside this trigger, if you enter StReflectionFall, the amount of time before you start falling is changed from 2 seconds to a configurable delay in frames.
